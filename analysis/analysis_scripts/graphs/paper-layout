1. abstract

2. Introduction
    Identify problem
        - detecting of anti patterns
        - why do devs decide to change CI tool
        -> research questions?
    Say what we do to find solution to this problem
        - develop tool
        - perform analysis based on study by people of Mons

3. Methodology overview
    -> tool discussion (introduction)
        - Link with CI Odor
            * highlight similarities/differences
        - Link with anti patterns from Duvall
    -> analysis overview
        - Link with work from people from Mons

4. Command line analysis tool
    - discuss workings
        * CI detection
        * Build collection
        * Antipatterns and how they are detected
            - late merging issue: no branch age collectible
    - show/explain results
    - validation

5. Analysis
    - analysis limitations
        - no skip failing tests data
        - sample size of 20 for travis -> gha
        - no historical data of branches
        - dataset is more than a year old (does not advocate for new changes)
    - data collection
        - show how data looks like
    - analysis execution
        - run of Python tool
        - gathering of data using python
        - visualization using matplotlib
    - analysis results
        - trends among anti patterns
        - hypotheses of why developers switch

Discussion
    Threats to validity
        Internal
            - bugs in the implementation
            - analysis performed on historical data
        External
            sampling bias
    Future work
        analysis on more recent dataset
        analysis on larger samples
